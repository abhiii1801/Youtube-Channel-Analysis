# Youtube-Channel-Analysis
The provided Python script utilizes the Selenium library to scrape information from a YouTube channel. The main purpose is to gather data on videos, including details such as title, duration, upload time, likes, views, upload date, tags, and comments. The data is then stored in a Pandas DataFrame and saved to an Excel file.

The script begins by setting up the Selenium WebDriver for Google Chrome and defining necessary variables, such as the channel URL and a wait object. It also extracts the channel name from the URL.

The first major section involves scrolling through the channel page to load all available videos dynamically. This is achieved by repeatedly executing a JavaScript command to scroll to the bottom of the page. The total number of videos and their corresponding details are then extracted, including titles, durations, and upload times.

The script then iterates through each video, navigating to its individual page to extract additional information like likes, views, upload date, tags, and comments. There's error handling in place to manage potential issues with extracting this data.

The extracted information is stored in two separate Pandas DataFrames: one for video details and another for video statistics. These DataFrames are then concatenated horizontally based on the video index.

Finally, the combined DataFrame is saved to an Excel file named after the YouTube channel, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis. The entire process is encapsulated within a main function, and the script is executed with a specific YouTube channel URL as an example.

The YouTube channel data, extracted and stored using Python, can be further analyzed and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn for charts depicting likes, views, and trends over time. In addition, Excel's conditional formatting is employed to dynamically color cells based on performance criteria, enhancing the visual presentation of key metrics. This dual approach offers a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the YouTube channel's performance.
